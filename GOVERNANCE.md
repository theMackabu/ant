- Feature requests are discussed in GitHub issues

### Significant Changes

1. Open an issue or discussion for community input
2. Allow reasonable time for feedback
3. Maintainer makes final decision

## Contributions

- Demonstrated good judgment
- Alignment with project values

## Releases

- Releases are made at maintainer discretion
